# MicrobeDB

## How to access
MicrobeDB is distributed using the CERN VM File System (CVMFS). Docker and CSI deployment recipes are available in `./destinations`.
The recipes are executed by [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/).

Docker may fail to unmount CVMFS during shutdown, run `sudo fusermount -u ./microbedb/mount` if you encounter `transport endpoint is not connected` errors.

### OSX Peculiarities

OSX does not natively support Docker, it runs Docker within a Linux virtual machine. This workaround means that support is limited to only the most
basic use case. While mounting MicrobeDB via CVMFS, it will fail with an error.

To work around this CVMFS must be installed and configured manually. First ensure that [FUSE](http://osxfuse.github.io/) is enabled by
running `kextstat | grep -i fuse`. Download the [CVMFS package](https://ecsft.cern.ch/dist/cvmfs/cvmfs-2.8.0/cvmfs-2.8.0.pkg). Install the pkg and
reboot. Copy [../destinations/docker/cvmfs.config](../destinations/docker/cvmfs.config) to `/etc/cvmfs/default.local`.
Copy [./microbedb.brinkmanlab.ca.pub](./microbedb.brinkmanlab.ca.pub) to `/etc/cvmfs/keys/microbedb.brinkmanlab.ca.pub`. Ensure everything is
configured properly by running `sudo cvmfs_config chksetup`. You **MUST** mount the CVMFS repository under a shared folder as configured in your
Docker settings for it to be accessible by Docker. By default `/tmp` should be included as a shared folder and you can mount the repository to `/tmp/microbedb`. 
Ensure `/tmp/microbedb` exists and run `sudo mount -t cvmfs microbedb.brinkmanlab.ca /tmp/microbedb`.

## Schema documentation
Run `sqlite3 microbedb.sqlite '.schema'` to view documentation of the various tables and columns.
The assembly table is largely undocumented because NCBI does not document their data schemas.

## Working with taxonomy data

Use SQLite recursive query to determine if tax_id is subclass of ancestor. The following returns 1 if the query_tax_id is a subclass of ancestor_tax_id:
```sqlite
WITH RECURSIVE
  subClassOf(n) AS (
    VALUES(query_tax_id)
    UNION
    SELECT parent_tax_id FROM taxonomy_nodes, subClassOf
     WHERE taxonomy_nodes.tax_id = subClassOf.n AND taxonomy_nodes.tax_id != ancestor_tax_id
  )
SELECT 1 FROM subClassOf WHERE n = ancestor_tax_id LIMIT 1;
```

## Build requirements
- [bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/)
- [yq](https://pypi.org/project/yq/) which also installs the xq executable
- [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/) compiled with ONIGURUMA regex libary
- [Entrez CLI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK179288/)
- [SQLite3](https://www.sqlite.org/download.html)
- [GNU awk](https://www.gnu.org/software/gawk/)
- [parallel](https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel/)
- [gzip](https://www.gnu.org/software/gzip/)
- [biopython.convert](https://pypi.org/project/biopython.convert/)

Ensure the `find` command supports `-empty` by running `find --help | grep '-empty'`.
The most recent CVMFS commit of the repository must be mounted on all compute nodes.
`cvmfs_config` must be accessible on all compute nodes.
